## Purpose and Context

These backlog documents serve as the **source of truth** for what needs to be built. They are used to:

1. **Create GitHub Issues**: Each backlog item can be converted to GitHub issues using the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. **Track Progress**: Monitor implementation status and completion
3. **Plan Releases**: Organize features into specific releases
4. **Guide Development**: Provide clear requirements and acceptance criteria

## Backlog Management

- **One Feature Per File**: Each feature has its own dedicated file for better organization
- **Priority Levels**: Features are categorized by priority (High, Medium, Low)
- **Component Organization**: Features are grouped by system component
- **Dependencies**: Clear dependency tracking between features

## Adding New Features

When adding new features to the backlog:

1. **Create Individual File**: Each feature should have its own `.md` file
2. **Follow Template**: Use the established format with Feature Status, User Story, Acceptance Criteria, etc.
3. **Update README**: Add the new feature to the appropriate section in this README
4. **Set Priority**: Assign High, Medium, or Low priority
5. **Specify Component**: Identify which system component the feature belongs to
